title: About me
---

I am a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at The Ohio State University working under [Dr. Ayonga Hereid](https://mae.osu.edu/cyberbotics) working on bipedal locomotion for humanoids and exoskeleton devices. I'm using optimization, template-based planners and non-linear control as the basis of my research. On the implementation side, I have developed C++ code to manage sensor data and compute real-time control algorithms for our robotic systems. I've previously completed a MSc. in Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M University working on bipedal locomotion and lower-limb  prosthetic devices.
